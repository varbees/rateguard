# Release Notes

## Unreleased

- Reduced Go in-process limiter contention by moving hot bucket mutation behind
  per-key locks instead of the manager-wide cache lock.
- Added hard token-budget reservations in Go, Node.js, and Python so concurrent
  requests cannot spend the same remaining budget before usage is recorded.
- Released or committed reservations after response observation, including the
  no-token-usage path.
- Reworked Node.js and Python hot-path pruning to mutate existing timestamp and
  budget record buffers instead of rebuilding arrays/lists on every request.

## v0.1.0

Release date: 2026-05-16

RateGuard `v0.1.0` is the first middleware-first SDK release under the
`varbees/rateguard` repo.

### Packages

| Runtime | Package | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Go | `github.com/varbees/rateguard/packages/sdk-go` | `go get github.com/varbees/rateguard/packages/sdk-go@v0.1.0` |
| Node.js | `@varbees/rateguard-node` | `npm install @varbees/rateguard-node@0.1.0` |
| Python | `varbees-rateguard` | `pip install varbees-rateguard==0.1.0` |

### Highlights

- In-process rate limiting for service middleware.
- Token budget helpers for LLM-heavy paths.
- Circuit breaker support.
- Request event emission with local console fallback.
- Go `net/http` and chi middleware.
- Node Express, Fastify, Hono, and Next route-handler support.
- Python ASGI, WSGI, decorators, and high-level budget helpers.

### Published Artifacts

- Go module tag: `packages/sdk-go/v0.1.0`
- npm package: `@varbees/rateguard-node@0.1.0`
- PyPI package: `varbees-rateguard==0.1.0`

### Verification

The release was verified with:

```bash
cd packages/sdk-go
CC=/usr/bin/gcc GOWORK=off go test ./...
GOPROXY=proxy.golang.org go list -m github.com/varbees/rateguard/packages/sdk-go@v0.1.0
```

```bash
cd packages/sdk-node
bun run typecheck
bun run test
npm publish --dry-run --access public
npm view @varbees/rateguard-node version
```

```bash
cd packages/sdk-python
RATEGUARD_STRICT_TYPES=1 python3 scripts/typecheck.py
python3 -m pytest -q
python3 -m build --sdist --wheel
python3 -m twine check dist/*
python3 -m pip index versions varbees-rateguard
```

Fresh public install smokes were also run for Go, Node, and Python.

### Known Constraints

- Go publishing uses the submodule tag form `packages/sdk-go/vX.Y.Z`.
- Python installs from the distribution name `varbees-rateguard`, while the
  import package remains `rateguard`.
- The SDKs are intentionally standalone-first; hosted control-plane behavior is
  not part of this release.
