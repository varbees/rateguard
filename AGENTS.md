# RateGuard — AI Agent Contract

> **Load this file first.** Every agent working on RateGuard must read this before touching code.
> RateGuard is an AI-native rate limiting SDK for Go, Node.js, and Python — middleware, not a proxy.

## Architecture

```
RateGuard is MIDDLEWARE (runs inside your app process)
  NOT a proxy (LiteLLM, Portkey, Helicone)
  NOT a gateway (Kong, Tyk, Apigee)
  NOT a library (express-rate-limit is JS-only)

Three SDKs, same core behavior with idiomatic language surfaces:
  packages/sdk-go/     → Go (net/http, chi) — reference implementation
  packages/sdk-node/   → Node (Express, Fastify, Hono, Next) — mirrors Go
  packages/sdk-python/ → Python (ASGI, WSGI, FastAPI, Flask) — mirrors Go
```

## Core Algorithm (identical across all 3 SDKs)

```
Token Bucket (RFC standard, same as Kong/Envoy/AWS):
  tokens = min(burst, tokens + elapsed × rps)
  Allow: tokens >= 1.0 → consume 1
  Deny:  retry_after = ceil((1.0 - tokens) / rps) × 1000ms
```

## Rules for agents

1. **Parity across 3 SDKs.** If you add a feature to Go, add it to Node and Python in the same commit or the very next commit. Same algorithm, same API, same behavior.
2. **Tests before merge.** Every commit must pass `go test`, `bun test`, `pytest`.
3. **No new dependencies without reason.** The Go Prometheus endpoint uses stdlib only. Follow that pattern.
4. **Commit as varbees.** Conventional Commits: `feat(sdk-go):`, `fix(sdk-node):`, `docs:`, `chore:`.
5. **No Co-Authored-By.** Author is always `varbees <harshavar968@gmail.com>`.
6. **The SDKs stay proxy-free; companion tools are sanctioned, scoped, and separate.** The core positioning — in-process, zero extra infrastructure — is for code you own. `packages/dashboard` (observability/control-center UI) is a deliberate, explicitly-approved companion tool — it lives in its own `packages/*` directory, depends on the SDK like any consumer, and never gets imported by the SDKs themselves. Billing, marketplace, and multi-tenant-platform code still don't belong here — the legacy full-stack product is on `legacy/full-stack`.
7. **Verify formulas.** Every formula must cite its source (RFC, Wikipedia, academic paper). No hand-waving.
8. **Model pricing must be verifiable.** Every price in the pricing table must be checkable against the provider's public pricing page as of the commit date.
9. **A feature isn't done until it's wired.** A module that exists but isn't exported from the package entry point, isn't reachable through the middleware/facade, or isn't exercised by a test that drives the public surface is NOT a feature — don't mark it ✅ or document it as shipped. (July 2026 audit found MCP tools, guardrails, loop detection, GenAI OTel, and Prometheus counters all existed as files but were unreachable by users.)
10. **Pre-flight queries must never consume.** Anything advertised as a "check before you call" (MCP tools, dashboards) must use Peek/read-only paths — never `Allow()`, which consumes a token, and never `breaker.Allow()`, which claims the half-open probe.
11. **Transports must be byte-transparent.** The outbound wrapper delivers the exact bytes the provider sent — never rewrite line endings, never buffer a stream whole, never alter framing. Usage extraction happens on a bounded side-scan (see `sse_usage.go`).
12. **Streaming usage events must be decoded individually and merged with MAX semantics.** OpenAI sends `"usage":null` in every intermediate chunk; Anthropic splits input (message_start) from output (message_delta) and repeats fields. Concatenating chunks or summing fields double-counts — all three SDKs merge per-event maxima.
13. **Parity claims must be conformance-tested, not assumed.** `conformance/token_bucket_vectors.json` is the shared oracle all 3 SDKs replay (`TestConformanceTokenBucket`, `conformance.test.ts`, `test_conformance.py`) — a passing per-language test suite does not by itself prove cross-language behavioral parity. `retry_after_ms` rounding is unified across all 3 SDKs (ceil to the nearest whole second, floored at 1000ms) and asserted by the conformance vectors on every deny step, including a >1s-deficit case that distinguishes whole-second ceiling from millisecond ceiling. `conformance/budget_attestation_expiry_vectors.json` is the same idea for budget attestation: Go's time.Time JSON marshaling trims trailing zero fractional digits, Python's isoformat emits fixed microseconds, and Node's toISOString emits fixed milliseconds — three different byte strings for the same instant, silently breaking cross-language Ed25519 verification. `expires_at` is truncated to whole seconds before it enters the signing payload in all 3 SDKs (`TestConformanceBudgetAttestationExpiry`, `conformance.test.ts`, `test_conformance.py`) specifically to remove the fractional component that caused the mismatch.
